# Satisfaction Prediction using Factor Analysis-enhanced Classification
This repository contains code and resources for building a classification model to predict passenger satisfaction , utilizing factor analysis for feature selection and enhancement.

# Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that classifies passengers' satisfaction based on  attributes. By leveraging factor analysis techniques to identify and enhance relevant features, we aim to understand how different conditions influence passenger satisfaction levels.
